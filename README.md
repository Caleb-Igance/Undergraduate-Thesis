# Undergraduate Thesis: Text Recognition Using Fourier Transform as a Metric.

This project was undertaken as a senior undergraduate thesis at East Tennessee State Univserity. My thesis advisor was Dr. Jeff Knisley. Due to the mathematical nature of the project, Latex is the best way to present what is included in these files: a full description can be found in the file **Description.pdf**.
